<!-- 			<p>
				A quantum computer is just a collection of 
				<a href="Q-Qubit.html">qubits</a>.
				These qubits hold values like 
				<code>1</code>, <code>0</code>, or some value inbetween.
				A quantum computer 
				is able calculate things
				by changing the value of its qubits.
				We tell the computer exactly how it should change 
				the value of a qubit
				by instructing it to apply 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate" target="_blank">quantum gates</a> 
				to the qubit
				in a particular sequence.
				We can think of this as choreographing a dance;
				the qubit dances through a sequence of gates 
				and as it dances through each gate 
				it will change the style in which it dances.
			</p> -->
			<p>
				Quantum circuits are represented by diagrams similar to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)" target="_blank">musical staves</a>. 
				When a musician reads a line of music 
				she begins at moment zero on the left edge
				and proceeds forward in time by reading to the right. 
				In this example we can see 
				from the ornate figure on the left
				that the pitch of the notes will be described by a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clef" target="_blank">C clef</a>
				and that each measure will span three beats
				thanks to the 3/4
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature" target="_blank">time signature</a> notation.

				Similarly, quantum circuit diagrams are a series of moments in time,
				beginning at moment zero on the left edge 
				and proceeding forward in time by reading to the right.
				Here we have a quantum circuit that is 3 moments long
				and operates on just 2 quantum bits:

			<br>
			<p>
				Let’s read it from left to right, 
				observing what happens at each passing moment.
				We begin at moment zero (<code>t0</code>) with our initial qubit values.
				Both qubit #0 and qubit #1 begin with a value of <span class="complex-vector beta">0</span>.
				This is a <a href="Q-Qubit.html#.HORIZONTAL">“horizontal” qubit state</a>.
				In normal quantum circuit design these initial values will always be <span class="complex-vector beta">0</span>.
				Q, however, allows us to manually change these input values 
				to any possible qubit state
				so that you may simulate a snippet of a complete circuit.
				We’ll come back to this later, but for now let’s read on.
			</p>
			<p>
				During our first moment of true operation (<code>t1</code>)
				we apply a <a href="Q-Gate.html#.HADAMARD">Hadamard</a> gate to qubit #0,
				putting it in to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" target="_blank">superposition state</a>.
				(This is represented by the “H” within a square on qubit #0’s circuit wire.)
				We leave qubit #1 as-is by
				applying an
				<a href="Q-Gate.html#.IDENTITY">Identity</a> gate; a
				<code>null</code> operator or “do nothing” gate.
				This is represented by the small circle on qubit #1’s circuit wire.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our next moment (<code>t2</code>) we operate on both qubits at once
				by applying a <a href="Q-Gate.html#.CONTROLLED_NOT">Controlled-Not</a> gate.
				This operation will flip the value of qubit #1 if, and only if, 
				the value of qubit #0 collapses to <span class="complex-vector beta">1</span>.
				This action 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit#Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank">entangles the two qubits</a>;
				their states are now dependent on one another.
				At this point it is impossible to compute the values of either
				qubit #0 or qubit #1 independently.
				From here onward the state of the circuit
				can only be computed as a whole.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our circuit’s final moment (<code>t3</code>)
				we apply a
				<a href="Q-Gate.html#.PAULI_X">Pauli X</a> gate
				to each qubit, 
				flipping the value of both.
			</p>
			<h3 id="Writing_quantum_circuits">Writing quantum circuits</h3>
			<p>
				To create the above circuit we can take advantage of several Q shortcuts.
				To beging with, the <a href="Q.html"><code>Q</code> object</a> itself is a function
				that internally passes its arguments to the
				<code>Circuit.<a href="Q-Circuit.html#.fromText">fromText()</a></code>
				static method.
				This function can accept text as an argument, 
				but also accepts 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" target="_blank">Template literals</a>,
				which use backticks rather than single or double quotes, 
				and <em>do not require parentheses to invoke a function call.</em>
				Note the backticks and lack of parentheses in this example.
				We’ll call our example circuit “fox”:
			</p>
<pre><code>
var fox = <a href="Q.html">Q</a>`<strong>

	H-X#0-X
	I-X#1-X</strong>
`
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Q is rather flexible when it comes to parsing text into circuits. 
				New lines indicate a new qubit to operate on.
				Within a line, any non-alphanumeric character between alphanumerics
				is interpreted as a moment seperator.
				Therefore, the following (less sensible) input creates a circuit identical to the one above.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var fox = <a href="Q.html">Q</a>`<strong>H X#0--X
I  X#1   X</strong>`
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Internally, <code><a href="Q-Circuit.html#.fromText">fromText</a></code>
				is making the following calls to create the circuit.
				Note the extreme difference between
				the very little we must type (above) to create the circuit
				and the large amount of construction happening under the hood (below).
			</p>
<pre><code>

				Let’s create that fox circuit again using our compressed Q syntax.
				(This illustrates yet another small variation on the whitespace and gate separator used
				in the input <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Template literal</a>.)
			</p>
<pre><code>
var fox = <a href="Q.html">Q</a>`<strong>

	H  X#0  X
	
	I  X#1  X</strong>
`
</code></pre>
			<p>
				We can fully inspect our circuit as an object in the JavaScript console, of course. 
				But we can also get a summary overview with the following command.
			</p>
<pre><code>
fox.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>()
</code></pre>
			<p>
				This returns the following string.
			</p>
<pre><samp>
H-X#0-X
I-X#1-X
</samp></pre>
			<p>
				Does that look familiar?
				It’s very nearly the text we used to construct our circuit in the first place.
				In fact, because we can both construct and ouput circuits using text
				we can clone and test for equality between circuits like so.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var dog = <a href="Q.html">Q</a>( fox.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>() )

fox === dog<span class="comment">//  false.</span>
fox.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>() === dog.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>()<span class="comment">//  true.</span>
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Though in practice you’re far more likely to clone a circuit 
				by using its own method for doing so.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var dog = <strong>fox.<a href="#.prototype.clone">clone</a>()</strong>

dog === fox<span class="comment">//  false.</span>
fox.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>() === dog.<a href="#.prototype.toText">toText</a>()<span class="comment">//  true.</span>

				With this in mind, Q offers full-on ASCII circuit diagrams.
			</p>
<pre><code>
fox.<a href="#.prototype.toDiagram">toDiagram</a>()

				Once a circuit is created it must be evaluated with 
				<code><a href="#.prototype.evaluate$">evaluate$</a>()</code>.
				This resolve’s the circuit’s state <code><a href="#this.matrix">matrix</a></code>
				and also notes the state names (binary digits)
				and their corresponding propabilities in 
				the instance’s <code><a href="#this.outcomes">outcomes</a></code> property.
				And that’s good.
				But what’s even better is seeing those results!
				A circuit’s <code><a href="#.prototype.report">report$</a>()</code> method
				will internally call 
				<code><a href="#.prototype.evaluate$">evaluate$</a>()</code> if need be, 
				then log out the possible outcomes,
				including bar graphs of the probabilities.

			<h3 id="Overlapping_multi-qubit_gates">Overlapping multi-qubit gates</h3>

				Some physical architectures allow for interactions between qubits that don’t resolve in to the simplest diagrams.
				Take this circuit, for example, which contains two C-not gates at moment 2:

<pre><code>
var cat = <a href="Q.html">Q</a>`<strong>

	I  X.1#0
	I  X.0#1
	I  X.1#1
	X  I</strong>
`
</code></pre>
			<p>
				We can see that they overlap. The first C-not [0] operates on qubit 0 and qubit 2, while the second C-not [1] operates on qubit 1 and qubit 3.
				We can see this slightly more clearly as a diagram
				with the <code>cat.<a href="#.prototype.toDiagram">toDiagram</a>()</code> command:

			<p>
				Let’s start with the <code>cat</code> circuit above, 
				and copy a section of it.
				In this case we’re copying all of its moments 
				and all of its qubits
				so it is effectively equal to 
				<code>cat.<a href="#.prototype.clone">clone</a>()</code>:
			</p>
<pre><code>
var gup = cat.<a href="#.prototype.copy">copy</a>({
	
	qubitFirstIndex:  0,
	qubitRange:       cat.<a href="#this.bandwidth">bandwidth</a>,
	momentFirstIndex: 0,
	momentRange:      cat.<a href="#this.timewidth">timewidth</a>
})
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Both <code><a href="#.prototype.copy">copy</a></code>
				and <code><a href="#.prototype.cut$">cut$</a></code>
				are very flexible with the parameter object.
				Supplying no parameters is effectively equal to selecting the entire circuit.
				(So the above example is a bit superfluous, but socratic.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Cutting replaces the “cut” operations with Identity gates
				and returns the cut portion.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var hen = gup.<a href="#.prototype.cut$">cut$</a>()
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Cutting <em>all</em> of the operations as above
				will yield a blank circuit as seen below. 
				(And <code>hen</code> will now contain those cut operations.)

				Pasting in to a circuit can cause that circuit to expand
				in both time and qubits.
				For example, both our <code>cat</code>
				and <code>gup</code> circuits are 4 moments long (0, 1, 2, 3)
				and 5 qubits in bandwidth (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
				What if we paste our <code>cat</code> circuit
				in to our empty <code>gup</code> circuit
				but do so by pushing it one moment further and one qubit further?
			</p>
<pre><code>
gup.<a href="#.prototype.paste$">paste$</a>( cat, 1, 1 )
</code></pre>
			<p>
				Notice how <code>gup</code> has now expanded.
				The first qubit registers are still empty.
				The first moment of qubits also remains empty.
				But the entirety of <code>cat</code>
				is now pasted in there.
